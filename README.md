# Embedded
Code developed to learn embedded software programming following University of Colorado at Boulder's course, in Coursera.
The first exercise, called "Stats", is the coding of functions that calculate some statistical measures for a C array.

The second exercise is to create a build system with "Stats" and "m2" code from Fosdick's repository.

Pending:

- edit main.c to switch between course\*.c files
- create course1.c file
- edit Makefile:
  - to update paths
  - to add -DCOURSE1 compile time variable
  - to add -DVERBOSE compile time variable
